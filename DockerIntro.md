Overview of Docker:
-------------------

Docker is an open source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating system-level virtualization on Linux
Docker packages an application and all its dependencies in a ‘virtual container’ so that it can be run on any Linux system or distribution
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container
